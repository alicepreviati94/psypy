psypy is a python library that calculates psychrometric states of moist air. Atmospheric  pressure, and two independent properties must be given to calculate all other state properties. The state properties include: dry bulb temperature (DBT), specific enthalpy (H), relative humidity (RH), specific volume (V), humidity ratio (W), and wet bulb temperature (WBT). The library uses ASHRAE 2009 Fundamentals formulations to calculate property values.
